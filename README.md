# -Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes using machine learning models. We use the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, a widely-used benchmark for medical prediction tasks, containing 768 records with 8 health-related features (like glucose level, BMI, and age) and a binary outcome (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic).
